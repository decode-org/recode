# Recode

Pronounced like *record* but with code, instead.

Video tutorials are fantastic for getting information across quickly, but when pertaining to code, they always seem old fashioned. This is because seeing code appear in a compressed, lossy video doesn't look as crisp as it can, and it isn't interactive (no copy + paste!). Here's the solution: hit record in your text editor, record your video/audio, and then play them back in tandem.
